I am a UC Irvine Statistics PhD candidate and my research interests include:

- Biostatistics
- Bayesian methodology
- Stochastic processes
- Statistics and data science education

My current methodological work is in improvement of real-time phylodynamic inference methods to account for delays in sequence data reporting.

Starting Fall 2025 I will be an Assistant Professor of Data Science at [CSU Channel Islands](https://www.csuci.edu/)!
