I am a UC Irvine Statistics PhD candidate and my research interests include:

-   statistics and data science education
-   epidemiological applications of statistics to better understand disease and infection

My current methodological work is in improvement of real-time phylodynamic inference methods to account for delays in sequence data reporting.
