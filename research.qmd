## Packages

The [gradetools](https://federicazoe.github.io/gradetools/) `R` package was created with data science instructors in mind. Assessing students with open-ended assignments (e.g. projects, interpretation questions) can be impactful but can also be arduous when it comes to grading. gradetools helps automate the grading workflow and facilitates in creating individualized assignment feedback for students.
